<br>
**RISC** : Reduced Instruction Set Computer , Closed sourse-ARM
<br>
**RISC-V** : It is an ISA based on reduced instruction set computer(RISC) principles. Open source
<br>
**Kernel** : Program to manage communication between software . User-level applications and hardware. CPU and disk memory
<br>
**DNS** : Turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources.
<br>
**ISA** : instruction Set Architecture , Hardware interaction , input - outputs , registers , data types 
<br>

**Switch** : Connects devices in a network to each other , enabling them to talk by exchanging data packets.
<br>
**Virtual Machine** : Created by using Hypervisor
<br>
**FPGA** : Field Programmable Gate Arrays . Array of Programmable logic block 
<br>
